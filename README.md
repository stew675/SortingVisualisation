# SortingVisualisation
Various Sorting Algorithm Visualisations Implemented in Java/Processing

A visual representation of various sorting algorithms and what they do with the contents of an array while sorting

Pressing the following keys have the associated effects:

- '1' - Represent values as vertical bars in  an XY space
- '2' - Represent values as dots in an XY space
- '3' - Represent values as dots within a spiral that has 3 rotations
- '4' - Represent values as colored bars in a 180 degree arc
- '5' - Represent values as short colored arcs in a 360 degree circle

- '*' - (Roughly) doubles the speed of the visualisation.  Can be pressed multiple times up to 10x speed
- '/' - (Roughly) halves the speed of the visualisation (down to 0.1x)
- '+' - Slightly speeds up the visualisation
- '-' - Slightly slows down the visualisation

- 'c' - Represents values as colors within the HSB color map
- 'r' - Starting with the next sort, the input data will be in reverse sorted order (press again to return to random order)
